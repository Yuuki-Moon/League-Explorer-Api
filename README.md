# League Explorer Api
**A C# .NET library for interacting with League Of Legends LCU and Web Api.**

### About this Project
This library is being developed alongside another project of mine and it's original goal was to provide the data I would need for said project. At some point I decided to make this a standalone library and release it separately, so here it is.

This library aims to interact both with the LCU League Api and the Riot's Web Api endpoints related to League of Legends.

The base code I started with and the inspiration for the came from <a href="https://github.com/Skinz3/League-of-Legends-Bot">Skinz3/League-of-Legends-Bot</a>
